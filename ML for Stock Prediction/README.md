# Machine Learning for Stock Prediction

Machine Learning (ML) uses data-driven algorithms to predict stock prices by analyzing historical data and identifying hidden patterns. It excels in capturing complex relationships and adapting to new data. Common ML techniques include:


# Key ML Models for Stock Prediction:

## Supervised Learning:

- Linear Regression: Predicts stock price based on a linear relationship with features (e.g., time, trading volume).
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Classifies price trends (e.g., bullish vs. bearish).
- Decision Trees/Random Forests: Captures nonlinear relationships in stock data.

## Unsupervised Learning:

- K-Means Clustering: Groups stocks based on similar performance or volatility patterns.
## Deep Learning:

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Handle sequential data, predicting future stock prices by analyzing temporal patterns.

## Reinforcement Learning:

- Optimizes trading strategies by learning from market actions and rewards.

# Advantages of ML for Stock Prediction:

- Captures Complex Patterns: Identifies nonlinear relationships between variables (e.g., volume, news sentiment).
- Adapts to Market Dynamics: Continuously learns from new data, improving predictions.
- Versatile: Works with a wide range of data (e.g., technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, news sentiment).

# Limitations of ML:
- Data Dependency: Requires large, clean datasets for accurate predictions.
- Black Box Nature: Difficult to interpret how decisions are made, especially in deep learning models.
- Overfitting Risk: Models may perform well on training data but fail in real-world scenarios.
